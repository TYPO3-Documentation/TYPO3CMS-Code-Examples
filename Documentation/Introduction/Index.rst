.. _introduction-what:

What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension contains a lot of code samples that are used throughout
the TYPO3 Core Documentation. The goals are two-fold:

#. provide an easy way for users to gain access to these examples for
   their own use.

#. store all code examples in a central place, so that it is easier for
   documentation maintainers to reproduce the examples from the
   documentation, in particular when refreshing the screenshots.

The usage of these examples is **not** explained in this manual. It
is explained in the relevant documentation.

Not all code examples from the Core Documentation will be moved here
as it is a rather huge task. Whenever possible code samples are taken
from the TYPO3 Core itself. Furthermore priority is given to those
code samples that are related to screenshots.
